now all the docker files are ready

1: we need to create docker image from docker files
   
     docker build . -t ui 

above command is used to build the image and tagiing the image to ui

2: we need to create a container out of that image, we run command 

    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ui

it will create a container which will be accessed through 8080.


3: name the container
   
    docker run --name test ui(ui is my image name)

4: if docker file with some name then

   docker build -f filename.ee
